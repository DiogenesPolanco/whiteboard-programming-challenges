# Mixed JS Challenges

Whiteboard test challenge prep.
Some of the projects are not meant to be run, as the code provided abstracts some parts for increased readibility.

Challenges are meant to use node8.

## Rules
1) You are not allowed to run the test code in any editor or environment. These challenges are meant to be solved with "pen and paper".
2) You are only allowed to modify the code inside `/challenges`.
4) Other than the solution, you have to provide an explanation.
5) You are allowed to google questions you might have if absolutely necessary. Ex: googling what `Array.map()` does is *ok*, googling a js editor to check the code is *not ok*.
6) Might be obvious but do not read the solutions inside `/solutions` if you want to practice the challenges.

## Contribute
Contributing is easy, simply fork the project, clone it locally, add your challenge into the `/challenges` folder and provide a solution inside `/solutions` (can be a simple comment or more). Naming for the challenge must follow this format:
* `xx` being a number (just for sorting purposes)
* `challenge-name` be creative!
* (ONLY FOR SOLUTIONS) `-solution` quite self explanatory
* `.js` extension

Remember to add your name on `CONTRIBUTORS.md`!
